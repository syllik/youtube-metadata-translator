calling the live YouTube API.

The Translate page and supporting prompt page share the YouTube boundary,
selected video, source selection, and checked-in metadata catalog stored in
session state.
The public Data API has no exhaustive metadata-language listing endpoint, so
the repository snapshot is deliberately reviewable and versioned; it is not
derived from captions, audio, ISO lists, or private Studio endpoints. Each
metadata entry includes the source-localized name and a checked-in English
display name. The presentation formatter never changes the exact BCP-47 code.
Translate owns one internal translation draft, target selection, resumable
Codex batch checkpoints, and Preview/Publish state. The prompt page owns only
its ten-target selection and prompt/upload state. The default source is
authoritative and read-only; selected existing localizations are optional
verified references with real title/description metadata. Source and target
selection reset or normalize when the selected video or sources change.
Translate passes its complete remaining queue to the sequential Codex generator,
merges each validated checkpoint into the draft, and downloads that direct map
after each rerender. The Streamlit-facing generation controller owns one
process-local background job per translation owner. Worker threads never import
Streamlit or mutate session state; they emit only immutable snapshots and
validated batch events. The UI stores serializable job metadata and derives
remaining targets from the current committed draft. Source and target widget
reruns reuse the selected video's session resource cache; Preview, Publish,
Refresh, and Reset retain explicit fresh-state boundaries. The persistent
sidebar renders compact cards,
metadata-catalog counts, cursor-backed Load more, and destructive Reset
languages only in the selected-video Danger zone.
Reset uses fresh ETag conditional writes and post-write verification.
Successful Publish invalidates video-page cache before rerun. FAQ is static
and intentionally bypasses YouTube bootstrap and OAuth.

## 🧪 Run automated tests

Activate `.venv`, then run:

```bash
python -m unittest discover -s tests -v
```

The suite mocks both Codex and YouTube, consumes no Codex quota, and does not
require live YouTube or LLM credentials. A real YouTube smoke test is
intentionally separate because publishing changes an external channel.

The optional local Codex CLI is not installed by `requirements.txt`. Its real
generation smoke tests and batching checks are documented in
[LLM localizations](llm-localizations.md#recommended-first-smoke-test); do not
run them as part of the credential-free suite.

The channel profile localization CLI is dry-run by default. Its
`data/channel-localizations.json` input is user-owned, intentionally ignored by
Git, and must never be required by the test suite. Its write map is keyed by
exact Studio locale IDs observed from live channel resources (for example
`en_US` and `af_ZA`); the informational metadata-language codes in the local
file do not drive channel writes. Unit tests use temporary synthetic fixtures
for catalog validation, exact Studio-key usage, overlap protection, backup,
diff, merge-preservation, FAQ coverage, and verification helpers without
credentials. Running it with `--apply` is a separate live YouTube mutation
and must not be part of the credential-free test suite.

## 🧹 Run local checks

```bash
python -m compileall -q streamlit_app.py pages models.py language_catalog.py language_labels.py llm_localization_package.py codex_localization_runner.py codex_localization_generator.py generation_controller.py generate_codex_localizations.py update_channel_localizations.py services state ui youtube_account.py localizations.py localization_service.py tests
git diff --check
git diff --cached --check
python -m pip check
```

The dependency check may print a pip cache-permission warning; the relevant
success result is `No broken requirements found.`

## 🧩 Workflow boundaries

- Local JSON validation runs before preview; preview never writes.
- Publish validates again, refetches current state, compares only the video ID,
  writable snippet fields, and localizations against Preview, and performs at
  most one conditional update for one video using the fresh ETag.
- Existing localizations omitted from submitted JSON are preserved.
- Codex and valid external-LLM JSON become one internal translation draft; they
  do not replace unrelated draft entries.
- Generated or uploaded languages replace matching YouTube entries while
  omitted existing localizations remain preserved during normal Publish.
- Reset languages is the only full-localization deletion path and preserves
  default metadata through a separate reset payload. Its confirmed component
  event calls the API without navigating or changing URL parameters.
- Numeric Load more appends cached cursor pages; changing URL page resets the
  accumulated visible list. It is hidden for `all`.
- Translate and the supporting prompt use the same checked-in metadata catalog
  and source selection for the Streamlit session.
- Progress excludes the default language and all selected source languages;
  primary Translate targets default to all remaining metadata-catalog
  languages with no ten-language selection cap, while prompt targets select the
  first ten by default and have a hard limit of ten.
- Codex generation accepts explicit catalog-ordered target codes, batches them
  by `LLM_BATCH_SIZE`, and emits a completion callback only after exact JSON
  validation and merge. One Translate interaction processes the full remaining
  queue sequentially, skips valid draft entries on retry, and exposes the direct
  current draft through **Download JSON** even after a later batch failure. Its
  controller uses `start → poll → cancel → cleanup`; cancellation terminates
  the active process and never enters the retry path.
- Codex and external prompts receive the same primary/reference source model.
  An uploaded file must be an exact direct language-keyed YouTube map; wrapper
  metadata is never accepted.
- Preview never writes. Publish revalidates, refetches current state, rejects
  stale publish-relevant Preview state, conditionally writes when an ETag is
  available, merges omitted localizations, and refreshes the displayed YouTube
  progress. Any draft mutation invalidates Preview.
- `FAQ` can render without YouTube service construction, OAuth, or API access.

## ⏯️ Background generation lifecycle

The Translate Codex path is intentionally asynchronous so **STOP** can act on
the active `codex exec` process. `generation_controller.py` keeps live runtime
handles in a process-local registry rather than in `st.session_state`. The
runner uses `subprocess.Popen` with a new process group/session, the existing
environment allowlist, ephemeral read-only execution, temporary schema/output
files, bounded timeouts, redacted diagnostics, and exact localization JSON
validation. A batch becomes committed only after the process exits
successfully, the output file exists, and parsing plus validation succeed.

The UI accepts only matching, validated batch events for the selected video and
job. It applies each checkpoint once, invalidates Preview through the normal
draft merge, and recalculates **Remaining selected targets** from that draft.
The active fragment uses `st.fragment` when available and falls back to
`st.experimental_fragment`; the synchronous generator API remains available to
the CLI and credential-free tests.

Read [Translate workflow](translate-workflow.md) and
[LLM Translation prompt](llm-localizations.md) for the product constraints.

## 📝 Documentation changes

Keep `README.md` as the short entry point. Put long instructions in the
smallest relevant file under `docs/`, add a link from [the documentation
index](README.md), and use relative links so the guides work on GitHub and in a
local checkout.

## ➡️ Next step
