## 📖 Documentation rules

- Keep setup commands copy-pasteable.
- Link to an existing guide instead of duplicating long instructions.
- Keep historical design records and implementation plans separate from user
  setup help; do not use `superpowers` records as current instructions.
- Update links when a guide is renamed.
- Keep canonical documentation in English. Ordinary-user localized guides live
  only under `docs/i18n/<locale>/README.md` and follow the canonical guides.
- Keep `docs/development.md` English-only. Historical `docs/superpowers/**`
  files are not user documentation and must not be translated.
- Update the relevant documentation in the same change as code, UI, UX, or
  workflow changes.
